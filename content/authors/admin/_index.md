## About Me

Niccol√≤ Bisagno is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Information Engineering and Computer Science at the University of Trento, where he teaches Computer Vision and Signal Processing. He received his Ph.D. in 2020 from the ICT International Doctoral School at the University of Trento, Italy. In 2019, he was a visiting Ph.D. student at the University of Central Florida, Orlando, USA, and in 2018, at the Alpen-Adria-Universit√§t, Klagenfurt, Austria.
His research focuses on computer vision applications for human analysis, including human pose estimation, vision-based haptics, and trajectory prediction, with a particular emphasis on biologically inspired deep learning architectures and sports analysis applications. He has served as Co-chair of the 3rd International Workshop on Computer Vision for Winter Sports, hosted at IEEE WACV 2025, and as a Technical Program Committee member for the IEEE International Workshop on Sport Technology and Research 2024. He also serves as an associate editor for the Visual Computer journal and as a reviewer for relevant journals and conferences such as CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, and CVIU.

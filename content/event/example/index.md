summary: Seminar on holistic computer vision approaches for human analysis and the creation of immersive digital humans.
abstract: >
  Human-centered applications have been a driving force in computer vision research, aiming to bridge perception and interaction between humans and machines. In this seminar, we will explore a holistic approach to human analysis through the lens of computer vision, addressing both behavioral and appearance modeling toward the creation of "5D" digital humans. The talk will cover research advances in human trajectory prediction, biologically inspired deep learning architectures that mimic human cognitive processes, human pose estimation under challenging conditions, and applications in sports analytics. We will also dive into recent developments in high-resolution 4D avatar reconstruction and the integration of touch perception, paving the way for more immersive and realistic virtual human representations.
